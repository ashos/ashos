### Arch Linux gnome debloated ###
#gdm: either name of services to be enabled
#OR
#all the commands that ast needs to run inside the chroot <---- I think this is a more versatile idea (systemd, openrc, etc.)
# or maybe better urxvt
# iwd even better
# gnome-shell-extension-pop-shell-bin (from aur)
# OR sudo systemctl enable --now gdm3 ???
#gdm
#gnome-keyring
